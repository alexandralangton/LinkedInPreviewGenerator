# LinkedIn Preview Generator

A React and Node.js site which generates a Google search preview for a valid LinkedIn url.

### Installation Instructions

```js
git clone https://github.com/alexandralangton/LinkedInPreviewGenerator
cd LinkedInPreviewGenerator
npm install
Create a file called 'keys.js' inside the server/api folder (please contact me for the details)
npm run start
A local version of this site will then be accessible at http://localhost:3000/
```

### Notes

This site features requests to a custom Google JSON search API to return the desired information.

If were to continue on this project I would add in the ability to search through the top results, in case the primary result isn't the desired LinkedIn profile. I would also implement the ability to see and clear previous search results, rather than only viewing one at a time.

I have set up this repo in a way that lends itself to additional routes and a profile card history being added.

Please reach out with any questions!
